# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Authentication (Clerk)

This app uses Clerk for authentication.

1. Install deps (already added):

```
npm i @clerk/clerk-expo expo-secure-store
```

2. Create a Clerk project and get your Publishable Key.

3. Add the key to your Expo env (e.g. `.env` or env var):

```
EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxx
```

4. Start the app:

```
npx expo start
```

The app will redirect unauthenticated users to `/(auth)/sign-in` and signed-in users to `/(tabs)`.
