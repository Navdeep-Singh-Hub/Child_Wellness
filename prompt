Gaps and notes
JWT verification for API is TODO; identity flows via headers for now.
app/(tabs)/Profile.tsx imports useAuth from ../../src/auth/AuthProvider (native path) instead of from app/_layout. Works at runtime due to platform-resolved files, but consider normalizing imports.
Upload limit enforced (1MB). UI validates and surfaces user-friendly errors.
If you want, I can:
Set up Auth0 JWT validation middleware on the backend.
Add environment examples and a quick-start README update.
Normalize useAuth imports and tighten typing across the app.
I scanned the manifests and main frontend/backend modules and mapped endpoints, screens, and models end-to-end.
